## Okamimimi Lore
Okamimimi are often referred to as a wolfboy or wolfgirl depending on gender. It is also commonly shortened to okami.
COMMON - ~30% of population of Weyland

Okami appear predominantly human with distinctive wolf features: pointed, furry ears positioned on top of their head and a matching furry tail. Their fur coloration varies greatly - natural hair colors of okamimimi are exotic, with blue, red and green being most common, followed by black, grey, brown, cyan and, rarely, other colors. Their hands appear completely human, though they possess retractable claws that only emerge when emotionally triggered or consciously extended. Okamimimi have pronounced canine teeth and their blush colors often match their fur tone rather than human pinks (like Luna's purple blush). Okamimimi tend to be naturally strong and have heightened senses, particularly smell and hearing, though not to supernatural levels. They typically blend into human society relatively easily compared to some other demihuman types, though historical prejudices still occasionally surface.

Traits: retractable claws (only come out when highly stressed); NO HUMAN EARS (only wolf ears)

Culture: Okamimimi and Nekomimi have been integrated into European society for centuries, facing minimal discrimination in modern times - comparable to how Irish or French discrimination is now considered archaic.

MATE-MARKING: Traditionally, mates would bite each other's necks hard enough to draw blood and create permanent scars. These bite patterns serve as unique, visible "signatures" marking bonded pairs. Unlike rings, mate-marks cost nothing financially - their price is pain and permanence.

Modern attitudes toward mate-marking are mixed. Many now choose wedding rings instead, having seen their parents' generation bearing marks from failed relationships. Those with mate-marks today may be viewed as either deeply committed or impulsively naive. Early-life mate-marking (particularly during school years) carries significant social stigma, similar to teenage pregnancy.

SCENT MARKING: One tradition that persists is scent marking using cheek glands. This subtle practice remains important for marking mates and close friends, though the scent is often indistinguishable to non-okami. 

## Nekomimi Lore
Nekomimi are often referred to as a catboy or catgirl depending on gender.

COMMON - ~30% of Weyland’s population

Nekomimi share a similar appearance pattern to okamimimi, but with feline characteristics instead of canine ones. They have cat ears positioned on top of their heads and a cat-like tail, both covered in fur that typically matches or complements their exotic hair colors. Like okamimimi, they don't have fur covering the rest of their body - just the ears and tail. Their hands appear human but feature retractable claws. Their eyes sometimes have slightly more pronounced vertical pupils than humans, especially in low light or during emotional states.  Nekomimi have slightly more pronounced canine teeth.  Their ears and tails are extremely expressive, and many experience "primordial episodes" where instinctual cat behaviors emerge, particularly when presented with stimuli like laser pointers or dangly objects. They do not have whiskers.

Nekomimi were historically worshiped in many cultures, though this reverence has declined with time as their populations expanded and they became a common sight in modern society.

Traditions: scent marking mates and close friends by rubbing their scent glands in their cheek against the person 

## Kitsune Lore
Kitsune are often referred to as a foxboy or foxgirl depending on gender. Some Kitsune are descended from more magical ancestors that used to have 9 tails, but have since lost most of their magical abilities and less tails.

CULTURAL TRAITS: Kitsune culture is characterized by peace-loving values and harmony with nature. Unlike some demihuman cultures, they prefer scenting over biting for mate-marking and generally avoid violence. Kitsune are widely respected for their intelligence, work ethic, and ethical behavior, often finding themselves in positions of power through merit rather than ambition.
While this positive stereotype benefits their social standing, it creates intense pressure within Kitsune communities to excel, resulting in higher average stress and anxiety levels compared to other species. Despite their elevated social status, Kitsune typically remain humble and non-discriminatory toward other species.

MAGICAL HERITAGE: Kitsune are not inherently magical - magical abilities must be inherited genetically. The potency of these abilities has diminished over generations as magical bloodlines intermix with non-magical ones. Weyland University offers financial incentives to individuals with magical ancestry who participate in research studies.
The legendary nine-tailed fox stands as the most powerful ancestor in Kitsune magical lineage. While accounts vary regarding its exact nature (giant fox, humanoid kitsune, or shapeshifter), all agree it possessed nine tails and formidable magical abilities. Descendants of this bloodline typically exhibit multiple tails (2-4) and moderate magical talents, though the majority of Kitsune do not come from this bloodline and therefore only have a single tail.

TAIL SIGNIFICANCE: The number of tails a Kitsune possesses correlates with their magical potential and carries significant social meaning within Kitsune communities. Having fewer tails than family members can be a source of embarrassment, particularly in ancient magical bloodlines.

Traditions: scent marking mates and close friends by rubbing their scent glands in their cheek against the person
Kitsune culture in general is a lot more peace loving and in tune with nature, they dont particularly enjoy causing harm or pain. They tend to be non-violent.

## Haienamimi Lore
Haienamimi (ハイエナミミ), or Hyena demihumans, are a distinct and relatively uncommon type of demihuman in Weyland.
UNCOMMON - ~4% of demihuman population

Haienamimi appear predominantly human with the unmistakable features of a spotted hyena. This includes large, rounded, highly expressive ears on top of their heads and a short, tufted tail. Their hair often grows in patterns that mimic a hyena's coat, typically sandy, tawny, or dark brown with darker, splotchy spots. It is also common for these spot patterns to manifest on their skin as clusters of freckle-like markings, most often across the shoulders, back, and face.

Their most defining feature is their powerful physiology. Haienamimi exhibit pronounced sexual dimorphism where females are, on average, stockier, more powerfully built, and possess a greater physical strength than the males. All Haienamimi have a legendary bite force, supported by robust jaw muscles and canines that are visibly larger and sharper than even those of an Okamimimi. Like other demihumans, their claws are fully retractable and typically only emerge during moments of intense emotion or stress.

Culture & Society:
Haienamimi have a complex and often misunderstood place in modern society. Their famous vocalizations, which range from high-pitched giggles to loud, cackling laughs, lead to a common stereotype of them being either boisterously jovial or unsettlingly manic. Historically, they have been unfairly characterized as uncouth or brutish due to their raw physical power and a species-wide psychological trait known as Compulsive Gnawing Instinct.

This instinct is a deeply ingrained need to bite, chew, and gnaw, which intensifies during periods of high emotion (stress, joy, arousal). Believed to be a vestigial behavior from their bone-crushing ancestors, it now serves as an emotional release mechanism. This leads to many Haienamimi developing powerful oral fixations and a constant need to chew on objects. While this can be endearing in a controlled way, it is also the source of their reputation for being destructive.

Socially, Haienamimi structures often mirror the matriarchal clans of their animal counterparts, with females naturally taking more assertive and dominant roles in relationships and group dynamics. They are fiercely loyal and protective of their chosen family or "clan," but their abrasive exterior and destructive tendencies often make it difficult for outsiders to see the deep-seated affection that motivates them. They value durability and resilience above all else, both in objects and in people.

## Itachimimi
Itachimimi, or Weasel demihumans, have shorter lifespan than most but longer than the Nezumimi (60-85 years)

Small part of the global pop (~1-2%)

You probably expected this but they have a bad reputation for being gluttonous - they have faster immune systems than most other animals their size, so they have a tendency to both out-eat other species..

... and to collect or demand more food than may be strictly necessary for themselves

They also have a reputation for being sneaky deviants but thats just good ol racism

## Wendigo Lore
Wendigo and Leshens (or lescy in slovic) are one and the same. They exist throughout the world and different cultures call them different things and attribute different values and folklore to them.

They are, in all instances, guardians of the natural environment where they live.

The story of the wendigo - a belief that they are formed when humans cannibalize eachother - is another piece of misinformation spread by generations of people too terrified of the creatures to understand them.

Its simple - humans would enter and demolish natural habitats and, on occasion, leshens/wendigo would strike out and horrifically attack populations in defense of their homeland.

This especially intensified during colonization, when Wendigo (as will be explained further down) would seek to protect native american tribes.

In doing so, they became faces of terror and were viewed as devils and demons. To the wendigo, humans were the obvious aggressors. Those that respected nature and wildlife were always spared or ignored entirely.

## Scent Marking
Many demis practice scent marking. They have specialized glands in their cheeks that allow them to scent things they rub on with their own scent.

As a human, you probably wouldnt notice anything. Morgan, you have cats, right? If they walk up and rub their face on you, they are scenting you. But we as humans cant detect the difference

As an okamimimi or nekomimi though, its a big deal. Its obvious when someone has scent marked you - you might as well be walking around with a promise ring on. 

To the characters, being able to scent mark you is a huge thing of trust and devotion. They often dont ask because its frequently seen as a "weird" or "possessive" thing to do, so if YOU suggest it to them, its almost more meaningful to them.

It isnt all positive though. Controlling boyfriends might scent their partners every night, or insist on scenting them before they leave every day. A little scenting here and there is okay, but if your friends and family noticed you being constantly scented, people may begin to worry about you.

## Kemetism
In Weyland's world,  Kemetism, the religion of the ancient Egyptians, never went away. Its fundamentally very different though, and places nekomimi on a pedastal above other races. Its never explicitly stated that nekomimi are superior to other demihumans, but they are considered to be the only demihumans capable of kemetic priesthood and other races are unable to achieve positions of authority in the church. 

Kemetism also has different branches devoted to different Gods. Bastet, a yet-unreleased nekomimi princess, is the religious icon of the Sect of Bast, a branch of Kemetism that focuses on the worship of Bast (the god of fertility, love, protection and safety). As an icon, many people worship Bastet directly,  seeing her as a conduit to Bast herself.

So if you asked a Kemetic priest if nekomimi are better or superior to any other race, they would strongly oppose that.

...But the priest you would be talking to would, themselves, be a nekomimi, and would likely be made uncomfortable if you were to point that out. "Its just traditional."

Regardless of intention, the views of the Kemetic church still carry influence on Nekomimi culture. While many Nekomimi prescribe to other religions and feel unaffected by the church, there exists more radical groups that feel that the importance of Nekomimi has been grossly understated - that they are more valuable physically and spiritually compared to other races. These views might be expressed by your Nekomimi grandmother in passing, or be written in hateful messaging on a flag flying in your neighbor's lawn.
